# This template describes a VPC endpoint to securely route traffic within a VPC for private instances to access S3
# without the need of a NAT Gateway, NAT instance, or public internet.
#
# See: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/vpc-endpoints.html
#
# By default, access to all S3 actions and buckets is allowed, but may be constrained with a policy document.
